On a daily basis, large data sets are routinely generated by activities in the sciences, administration, leisure and commerce. Data scientists are constantly seeking patterns and predicting outcomes from these vast collections of data.\n\nThe four-year direct Honours programme in Data Science and Analytics (DSA) is designed to prepare graduates who are ready to acquire, manage and explore data that will inspire changes around the world. Singapore is a financial hub, with key industries focusing on biomedical sciences, health care, manufacturing, e-commerce and sustainable energy, among others. The DSA programme will equip its graduates with the skills to contribute to the activities of these industries. They will be able to handle problems like uncovering hidden stock market indicators, extracting information from medical images, predicting consumer behaviour and a host of similar interesting questions.",
